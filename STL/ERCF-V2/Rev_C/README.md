# **Some notes on how to use the version C6 and C7**
## **Warning**
* **Version  C6 and C7 only works with Sturdy Bunny or coming soon V2.**
* **Version C7 only works with Happy Hare V2 and his 3 positions servo capability.**
* **Version C7 tophat can't work if you have the 2 magnets on your encoder cart.**

* **For best results with the C6 magnet release trap, be sure to use **N52 Magnets** on the encoder and the top of the filament exit. Secure the magnets in the encoder with a drop of glue, otherwise they will pop out when they are above the gate magnet.**

 For all versions, print print the latch **[a]Triple_Decky_Latch_RevC6_0.stl** from the folder STL\Sturdy Bunny\Rev_C
